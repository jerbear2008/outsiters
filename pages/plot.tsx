      <h2>Exposition</h2>
      <p>The story starts as Ponyboy gets jumped by a group of Socs on the way home from the movies. Ponyboy then explains the difference between Socs and greasers, as well as the tension between them and the culture of the area. When his gang comes to help him, he gives information about each of his gang's members.</p>
      
      <h2>Rising Action</h2>
      <p>The main rising action of the book is when Johnny kills Bob. The event happened in the first place because of the social differences between Socs and greasers. Sodapop and Johnny flee because they think that the police would never believe them. This serves to escalate the main conflict of class differences to a more tangible level. The time in Windrixville also expands on this.</p>
      
      <h2>Climax</h2>
      <p>The climax is when Johnny dies. It is especially emotional as he had finally become separated from the class stereotypes that are the basis of the novel's conflict. He was finally able to be viewed as a hero, not a greaser. This is the most emotionally charged moment in the entire book.</p>
      
      <h2>Falling Action</h2>
      <p>Dally dying and Ponyboy fainting is the start of the falling action. Ponyboy faints and is in a confused and lost state. He put himself back together and came to terms with the deaths of two of his friends. This brings the conflict towards resolution.</p>
      
      <h2>Resolution</h2>
      <p>The final resolution of the conflict is when Ponyboy starts to write his theme. He decides to show people what is wrong with the class system. Randy also decides not to participate in the rumble, and Cherry, and all of the other Socs present testify that Johnny was acting in self-defense. These actions show the community moving away from classes, thereby resolving the conflict.</p>
