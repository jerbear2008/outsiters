      <p>The main conflict of the story is that of class differences between the greasers and the Socs. This underlying conflict sparks the more physical conflict between Johnny and Bob. When Johnny heroically sacrifices himself to save the children in the church, he is able to defy the stereotypes put on him by the social structure of greasers and Socs. He is able to be seen as a person, as a hero, rather than a no-good greaser. This inspires Cherry to testify for Johnny and makes Randy realize that violence is not going to help. As Ponyboy puts himself back together in the falling action, he decides he can show the world what is happening. He realizes that there are more kids in the world with the same situation as Johnny, put in a place they don&apos;t belong, struggling alone, and that he can shine a light on this. This parallels the author&apos;s personal story and reasoning for writing the novel, strongly emphasizing how S. E. Hinton is writing as Ponyboy, using the story as a vessel to convey her ideas about the world. This brings a final and satisfying conclusion to the fundamental conflict of the entire novel.</p>
